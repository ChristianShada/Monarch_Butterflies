NEW common milkweed SEEDS planted around April 1, 2016 are now showing as  one-inch tall two-leaf plants. Asclepias tuberosa Butterfly Weed plants (that we put in last fall) are growing and are now over 14 inches tall. They first showed up in mid-April 2016.

In the front yard, my former two large Common Milkweeds have returned, and sprouted an additional five, each several feet from the original tubers!  One came up right next to my new lilac bush, and two came up next to my very old holly bush. So there are seven in the front of the house and two in the back, plus three new Swamp Milkweed seedlings planted and taking hold. Now hopefully some critters will spread the word to let the Monarchs know that we have milkweeds for them!!",

I had boundless Milkweed and i would put the caterpillars in a safety area so prey couldn't get them, until they transformed into Butterflies.  Then I would release them.  I had LOTS AND LOTS of butterflies in my yard.  I could go to the plant nursery and pick up more Milkweed, and there were always eggs on the plants.  I'm shocked to see that the nurseries I have visited in the Arlington area do not have eggs.  I haven't even seen a Monarch in my neighborhood.  I'm shocked at how difficult it is to get a Monarch to your yard/plants, here.  If anyone lives near south Arlington that is active in the producing of the Monarchs, and has a plant that has eggs that they would be willing to share with me, please contact me at Gcayse1@aol.com.

There was also milkweed on the west side of the highway, but limited.  North of Bartlesville, saw some scattered viridis, but not near as much as south of Bartlesville.

This year the plants that came up in our yard have really multiplied greatly in one flower garden.  This type is known as the Common Milkweed.  The milkweed plants that were planted in the other flower garden did not fare as well, and not many have come back up this spring.  Last year we had Monarch eggs on our Common Milkweed which hatched into larvae.  We had a least one Monarch (and very possibly more) in the adult stage sitting and letting its wings dry.  The most we observed in the chrysalis stage was 13.  We are hoping to exceed that this year if all goes well.",

They are still being seen with our Waystation seeing our first May 27th 2017. The rest of Ontario is also seeing monarchs. With eggs being reported north of here &amp; much further north of here, and still not finding eggs on our milkweed, we went on an egg hunt today.  Myself &amp; a friend searched at least 1,000 Milkweed plants, mostly Common &amp; some Swamp, for eggs. We walked about 4 kms (Robson Rd to Pulford &amp; back) on The Monarch Trail (Leamington) searching both plantings by annual volunteers &amp; wild milkweed. Not one egg or larvae found. Only one plant had suspicious bite marks however no larvae was located. It is still early but interesting with eggs being found north of here &amp; no reports of eggs in Canada's far southwest.View The Monarch Trail photo album at-https://www.facebook.com/PeleeParadiseSanctuaryMonarchWaystation10275/",

We have a natural stream, we are a garden center/florist shop with native plants available for sale. We plant a full 20x50ft area with wildflowers for the honey bees and monarchs to feed. Last year I spotted only a mere few but this year with all the abundance of milkweed I hope they spot us. Thank you, Jeanne",

We found one plant that had eight stems.  This is a week or two later than norm but with the two hard freezes last month, one morning it got to 14 dF, we were afraid of that.  All would be better if we could get some rain ... just some would be nice.  We have some nice photos and will try to upload in the morning ... which is after noon for us now!

The stem is bent and twisted so that the crown with its circle of leaves is on the ground, but thankfully the stem did not get severed nor the crown broken off (which is what happened to many of the other milkweed plants). It survived and is now supporting this new life. If you look very closely you can see the larva on a leaf near the crown. (A close-up photo of the monarch larva is on the other report.)",

You can see sleet on the leaves.Our aquatic milkweed is doing very well, swamp milkweed just now coming up... sure hope it hangs in there tonite... looks like we are right on the edge of the predicted frost line... I will send pics either way.April 7:no frost last nite, but it turned colder this morning. The pics were taken at 10:45 CDT...temp: 32wind chill: 27light sleetmay get colder tonite... I will report tomorrow if needed.April 8:it got down to 30 last nite, no harm done.This morning I checked on the incarnata, which is in a different patch and I haven't checked on them in over a week as there had been little signs of emergence. Much to my surprise it seems the cold weather hasn't bothered them at all. Most (there are 20 or so) are nearly a foot tall or more. ",

But I was very surprised today when I saw a volunteer common milkweed in the back of my driveway that's already about 9 inches tall!  I don't know when it came up.  I don't know how I missed it, since I was cleaning up that bed recently.  I can only guess that I was looking for little buds coming up, and not recognizable plants.  The one in the picture showed up amid my weeds last year for the first time.  This year it has a few extra stems, plus a small neighbor who is probably attached by a root.I'm still expecting over 100 more plants to pop up over the next week in my yard.  But I won't report any more of them.  I just thought today's discovery was note-worthy, because all the rest that I saw yesterday were very small. I will be looking in other places where I was looking for eggs last year, though, to see when their milkweed shows up.",

The area is more moist which must make a difference. In the sanctuary (as in our fb cover photo) usually 200-300 mw plants come up. Asters, Goldenrod &amp; Thistles are also up about 6\".

Lots of buds and early flowers, well munched leaves & stems. 6pm visit. I did not see caterpillars or butterflies, but multiple plants had eggs under the leaves. Compared to other milkweed in the area,this seems ahead if the rest in flowering. This field was burned in late March/early April. Sorry no photo but pleased to make the report.",

Bluebonnets, verbena, and petunia are drawing in bees",

But I decided to see if any common milkweed was up yet, and found a sort of double bud.  The vertical one is just over an inch tall.  It showed up today, because I checked both places in the morning, and there was no sign of life in either area.  I didn't see any other common milkweed, but have a lot of vegetation that could be hiding it.  And a truck made a rut in the front stand when it backed into my driveway and veered off the blacktop.  So I'm hoping I won't lose any .My milkweed is over 2 weeks later than previous years when it would show up in late April.",

There are patches of 5-10-25 up to as large as 400. Majority is Common MW with 5% being Swamp. MW is 2-4' tall. It is mixed with plenty of Teesal, Goldenrod &amp; Asters(not yet bloomed), Chicory, Joe Pye, Dogbane, &amp; unidentied yellow flowers &amp; others. The most condensed area of milkweed is a 20 km stretch from Union Rd, Ruthven to Victoria Ave, Essex. Unfortunately an area near to Victoria on the north side of hwy 3 had been mowed. Unknown # of mw cut. An Essex resident said there had been alot...hundreds. Currently the only mw uncut is around trees. Unfortunately there is an area on Bevel Line Rd that is mowed weekly (more so this year than in the past...used to be cut 3x per season) MW was up again enabling us to count about 2500 (not included in 6720). We are working to determine owner. During our survey 8 adult Monarchs were seen flitting about the many Milkweed. ",

However, this Spring, probably because of the excessive rainfall (e.g., nearly double the normal amount for May) most of these fields did not get mowed until the end of June.  By then they already had lots of healthy milkweeds growing (and probably some eggs and caterpillars), as shown in photo #1.  Unfortunately, all that then got destroyed by the mowing, as shown in photo #2, perhaps losing a good portion of a generation of local Monarchs.  Note in the photo that not only was the field mowed, but so were the plants on the roadside side of the fence.<P>Meanwhile, at home, in the past we've raised several dozen common, swamp, and tuberosa milkweeds in individual pots, on which we place found eggs and caterpillars and then bring them inside for their protection until as adults they're ready to be released.  However, this year, knowing that I was going to have full left hip replacement surgery the beginning of July, it was clear that we were not going to be able to do the same this summer, which was just as well because when our potted milkweeds began sprouting this Spring, they quickly were attacked by hordes of oleander aphids.  The same soon became true for the various milkweeds we have planted outside our house.  Not a good year for healthy milkweeds, at least not in our neighborhood.<P>Granted, following my surgery thus far this summer, I'm not yet able to be out and about much, so my opportunities for observing Monarchs are pretty limited.  And up until Friday (7/26/2019) we'd yet to spot any Monarchs on the wing or to find any eggs or caterpillars this year on our outside milkweed plants; just lots of aphids. &nbsp; &nbsp; :-(<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  - Tim<P>P.S. - See my Monarch reports (to be posted soon) for 7/26/2019 and 7/27/2019 for some better news about local Monarch eggs, caterpillars, and butterflies. &nbsp; &nbsp; :-) ",

This was cut back 11/1/19 to encourage Monarchs to keep moving south, kept outside thru winter regardless of temperature. Native milkweed is NOT germinating or growing well in Central Texas; do not be judgmental. I have spent close to 100 dollars on native  milkweed seeds and plants, for the last 3 years with very small plants to show for it. Tropical was purchased as a supplement for monarchs in spring 2019. Monarchs found the native milkweed in ground but would have starved to death without supplementation. ",

It is located next to a business called fastenal. They mowed it down once last year and once this year. After the milkweed had grown back I went to look for more eggs. While I was looking around in the patch, a man from the business came out to ask me what I was looking for and I told him that I was looking for Monarch eggs!! I had a couple of leaves with eggs on them and the man asked to see it!! I asked him if he had kid's ( with intentions of telling him to share the magic of Monarch's and Milkweed with his kid's) but he told me he only had a dog!! I went back a week later to discover that they mowed around the large patch!! I think they avoided mowing the patch because of what I had told the man!!  Or at least that is my hope!!!  ",
